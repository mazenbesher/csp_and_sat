\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We discussed some mappings between the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) and the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). Some theoretical background has been introduced and based on general comparing criterion the encodings have been analyzed and compared against each other. It has been shown that the choice of an encoding has a large impact on the efficiency and solvability of the generated problem. Encoding CSP into simpler SAT problem has led to efficient instances of the original problem that can be solved quickly. This claim was supported with theoretical arguments and proofs specially in the case of some tractable CSP classes encoded using the order encoding. Based on similar encoding techniques various new SAT-based constraint solves have been developed. On the other hand, a variety of SAT to CSP encodings have been introduced. Although no SAT to CSP encoding has proven itself to be superior, a clearer picture of the relation between CSP and SAT has emerged and further studies can build upon these results.
