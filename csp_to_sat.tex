\section{CSP into SAT encoding}\label{sec:csp_to_sat}
Mapping a CSP problem into a SAT problem can be done in many ways. Several ways of encoding a CSP instance as a propositional formula have been proposed. The most common encodings are:

\input{direct_encoding}

\input{log_encoding}

\input{order_encoding}

\input{hybrid_encoding}
